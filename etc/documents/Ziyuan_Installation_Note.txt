PROJECT INITIAL SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Check out source code from Github: https://github.com/sunjun-group/Ziyuan.
	- Project folder includes 2 main sub folders, /app (store code), and /etc (store project settings, libs, ..etc).
2.	Update Maven settings:
	- goto /etc/maven, copy settings.xml --> local-settings.xml
	- open local-settings.xml: 
		+ modify <localRepository>D:/_1_Projects/Tzuyu/maven-repository</localRepository>, 
				set it to your local maven repository folder [upon your choice].		
3.	Make sure Ziyuan java dependencies will be available in local repository:
	- For the setting in maven pom.xml of tzuyu.parent, some special dependency are deployed onto nexus server which url is declared in
	settings.xml (or your local-settings.xml), and will be downloaded automatically during build process.	
	- Check if the nexus server is available or not:
		Open the url defined in your local-settings.xml to your web browser, if it renders the nexus page then the server is available.
	If server is available, you can jump to step 5. 
	If not available, 
		+ open local-settings.xml, comment this line:  
			<activeProfile>nexus-sever</activeProfile>
		+ Go to step 4.
4. 	Install jars:	
	- Download maven (binary package) at https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
	- Unzip maven to folder [mvn folder]
	- copy and override /etc/maven/local-settings.xml --> [mvn folder]/conf/settings.xml
	- Go to /etc
	For Window:
		+ copy win-setenv-example.bat --> setenv.bat
		+ modify setenv.bat, set absolute path to the folders on your local machine.
		+ run win-mvn-install-libs.bat 
	For Linux:
		+ copy linux-runall-example.sh --> linux-runall.sh
		+ modify linux-runall.sh, set absolute path to the folders on your local machine.
		+ run linux-runall.sh
5.	Set up Eclipse, and import project:
	- Open Eclipse.
	- Make sure that m2e plugin (maven to eclipse plugin) is installed.
